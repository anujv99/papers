# GSoC 2020: Integrating Signed Distance Field Generation in FreeType

Hello All,

My name is Anuj Verma and I am a participant of Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2020 with FreeType. I have been working on a project to integrate the generation of Signed Distance Field (SDF) into the FreeType library. This is the final project of my project as well as my experience with FreeType.

### Project Abstract

Over the summer I have been working on writing renderers for the FreeType library which are capable of generating Signed Distance Fields for two glyph format (i.e. Bitmaps and Outlines). To make this possible I have added a renderer module to FreeType's amazing modular architecture. The module consists of two renderers, one for each glyph format.
Apart from that I also wrote a small demo program to view the output of the renderers.

### Final Work Product
1. [SDF](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/src/sdf?h=GSoC-2020-anuj) module for FreeType which consist of two seperate renderers:
    - [SDF Renderer](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/src/sdf/ftsdf.c?h=GSoC-2020-anuj) which generate Signed Distance Field for vector fonts. (fonts which contain contours and paths for characters)
    - [BSDF Renderer](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/src/sdf/ftbsdf.c?h=GSoC-2020-anuj) which generate Signed Distance Field for bitmap fonts or for any arbitrary bitmap.
2. [FTSDF Demo](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2-demos.git/tree/src/ftsdf.c?h=GSoC-2020-anuj) program to view the output of the renderers.

### Introduction
Signed Distance Field is great when it comes to font rendering in real time graphics applications, they contain enough information to draw high quality fonts without the need of actual vector paths and complex calculations. Moreover due to the nature of distance fields they can be scaled almost upto infinity and because of that they are great in places where memory is limited because even a small distance field representation can be scaled up, to generate 4K images.

### Usage
Generating SDF from FreeType is pretty straightforward, the only thing that changes is the render mode. To generate SDF one must use `FT_RENDER_MODE_SDF` to render a glyph and then the output bitmap will contain SDF data instead of alpha values. Some notes:
1. Make sure to checkout the `GSoC-2020-anuj` branch.
```bash
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/freetype/freetype2.git
cd freetype2
git checkout GSoC-2020-anuj
```
2. The build procedure is exactly the same as the official release so refer to the [docs](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/docs?h=GSoC-2020-anuj) for how to build the library.
3. The official [tutorial](https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/tutorial/step1.html) can be used, the only thing that will change is:
```c
error = FT_Render_Glyph( face->glyph, render_mode );
```
In place of `render_mode` use `FT_RENDER_MODE_SDF`
```c
error = FT_Render_Glyph( face->glyph, FT_RENDER_MODE_SDF );
```
4. As of now the only documentation about the output is in the source code itself. The output of any render call in FreeType is a [`FT_BITMAP`](https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-basic_types.html#ft_bitmap). Most of the fields are exactly the same as given in the docs, the few things that are different are stated below:
    - [`pixel_mode`](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/include/freetype/ftimage.h?h=GSoC-2020-anuj#n160): The SDF module outputs a 16 bit buffer containing signed distance for each position on the grid.
    - `num_grays` : The output can have as many as 65535 different values.

5. There are also various properties that can be used to modify the output of the renderers. Here is a list of properties:
    - `spread` : Changes the maximum absolute distances in the output.
    - `flip_sign` : Changes the default sign of Signed Distance.
    - `flip_y` : Can make the output upside-down.
    - `overlaps` : Turns on overlapping support. (Only for `sdf` renderer)

More about the properties can be found [here](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/src/sdf/ftsdf.h?h=GSoC-2020-anuj). A little demo on how to modify the properties:
```c
FT_Error error = 0;
int spread     = 4;
int flip_y     = 1; /* This is a boolean property passed as an integer. */


/* The string names of properties are exactly the same as given above. */
error = FT_Property_Set( library, "sdf", "spread", &spread );
/* handle the error */

/* The `sdf' and `bsdf' renderers are different and their properties */
/* must be set individually.                                         */ 
error = FT_Property_Set( library, "bsdf", "flip_y", &flip_y );
```

### Usage [Demo Program]
There is also a demo program which can be used to test the output of the new renderers. The demo program is also integrated with FreeType2's official demo programs. To build and run the demo simply follow the official [guide](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2-demos.git/tree/README?h=GSoC-2020-anuj). A few notes:
1. Make sure to checkout the `GSoC-2020-anuj` branch.
```bash
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/freetype/freetype2-demos.git
cd freetype2-demos
git checkout GSoC-2020-anuj
```
2. Use the `ftsdf` demo program after the build step.
```bash
./ftsdf <point_size> <font_file>
```
3. After running the program press `?` or `F1` to see various keys which can be used to play around in the program.

### My Summer at FreeType:

#### First Month (June)

1. Writing a standalone renderer.
    - After some [discussions](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/freetype-devel/2020-05/msg00115.html) with my mentors and a few more people I decided to write a standalone [renderer](https://github.com/preversewharf45/freetype2-sdf) to generate SDF for font outlines.
    - Doing this gave me an overview of the working of the renderer and also gave me an idea of how to integrate the renderer into the existing codebase.

2. Using Fixed point arithmetic instead of floating points.
    - FreeType is a highly portable library and also works on embedded systems, because of that FreeType uses [Fixed point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic) arithmetic instead of Floating points. ([`discussion`](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/freetype-devel/2020-06/msg00125.html))
    - So then I started porting my existing standalone renderer to use Fixed Point format instead of floating points.
    - This was the most challenging part as it was the first time when I encountered Fixed Point arithmetic. But after a few frustrating days I managed to port the entire standalone [renderer](https://github.com/preversewharf45/freetype2-sdf/tree/FT_Fixed) to use Fixed Point.

3. Integrating the renderer in FreeType.
    - Around mid June I started integrating the standalone renderer into FreeType. For this I decided to create a new module named `sdf` and in that I added a renderer also named `sdf` which generates SDF for outlines.
    - I finished integrating the renderer at around the start of July. ([`1d5d8f~185d07`](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/diff/?id=1d5d8f&id2=185d07))

#### Second Month (July)

4. Optimizing the `sdf` renderer.
    - Next I started optimizing the `sdf` renderer. I tested a total of three optimizations:
        - [Bounding Box](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/src/sdf/ftsdf.c?h=GSoC-2020-anuj#n2996) Optimization.
        - [Subdivision](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/src/sdf/ftsdf.c?h=GSoC-2020-anuj#n3215) Optimization. This was my mentor's idea. (Thank you Alexei)
        - [Coarse Grid](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/src/sdf/ftsdf.c?h=anuj-distance-field#n3501) Optimization. This was Behdad's idea. (Thank you Behdad)
    - After a lot of testing and profiling I decided to use the Subdivision Optimization because it is the fastest of all three. ([`968a2f~1e3c41`](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/diff/?id=968a2f&id2=1e3c41))

5. Adding the renderer to generate SDF from bitmaps.
    - Around mid July I started writing the renderer to generate SDF directly from Bitmaps. The intention for writing this was because of bitmap fonts and because of a few limitations of the `sdf` renderer.
    - To integrate this I simply added another renderer named `bsdf` in the `sdf` module. This was relatively easier than the `sdf` renderer and took me around 20 days. ([`a9fbef~04f2a3`](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/diff/?id=a9fbef&id2=04f2a3))

#### Last Month (August)

6. Adding documentation
    - I spent the first week of august writing the documentation of all the changes that I made. The documentation was added directly in the source code. ([`307b0c~453988`](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/diff/?id=307b0c&id2=453988))

7. Overlapping support for the `sdf` renderer.
    - I spent the next week adding basic overlapping support for the `sdf` renderer so that it can generate SDF for glyphs with overlapping contours. Finally again Alexei gave me an amazing [idea](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/freetype-devel/2020-08/msg00021.html) for doing this. ([`f644a4`](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/commit/?h=anuj-distance-field&id=f644a47aaeb40f928e0284cd869352c28f99ae69))

8. Miscellaneous
    - Around the last few weeks of GSoC I started fixing bugs and memory leaks, adding more documentation etc. ([`64d1c2~b457ae`](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/diff/?id=64d1c2&id2=b457ae))
    - And finally I consolidated the entire code into a new clean [branch](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/log/?h=GSoC-2020-anuj)
    - I also created a small demo program to view the output of the renderers. ([`demo`](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2-demos.git/log/?h=GSoC-2020-anuj))
    
This concludes my exciting journey with FreeType.

# Limitation and future possibilities

I was able to achieve all the goals that I originally intended to do during the summer, however there are a few limitations of the renderers (in particular the `sdf` renderer) and a few more things that I'd like to implement further. Here is a list of things that I plan to do next in no particular order:

- Better overlapping support for the `sdf` renderer: The current overlapping support is good and works well for most cases, however it fails when there are self intersecting contours. This is perhaps the major limitation of the `sdf` renderer.
- Floating point arithmetic: The current renderers do not use floating points anywhere, due to this I used approximations at many places, and that affects the performance of the renderers drastically. Most modern hardwares now supports floating point calculations, so adding floating points alongside the current implementation can greatly improve performance and accuracy on modern hardware.
- Multi-Channel Signed Distance Fields: One of the limitations of distance fields itself is that it does not preserve sharp corners. [Chlumsky](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen) wrote a great paper which addresses this issue and gives a solution to fix it. Integrating it along with the current implementation will further improve the quality of distance fields.
- Better edge detection for `bsdf` renderer: The current `bsdf` renderer works really well in detecting edges and approximating them really close to the exact outline. However, it only works for anti-aliased bitmaps, for monochrome bitmaps it works poorly. So, adding a better edge approximation for monochrome bitmaps is something that can be done.
- Testing framework: Up until now I have been manually testing the renderers and their outputs. Setting up a testing framework will eliminate manual testing and also make the rendeeres more robust.

### And Lastly...
FreeType is an amazing library and is used in billions of devices by billions of people everyday and I'm really grateful that I got an opportunity to work on FreeType. I've been using FreeType for a couple of years, but I never really tried to understand how it actually works. Doing this project gave me a better understanding of the inner workings of FreeType and it's amazing architecture. I really appreciate everyone who has worked and is working continuously on the library to make it even better.

And finally I'd like to thank everyone who helped me during the project:

**Thank you, Alexei,** for being my mentor and giving your brilliant ideas and suggestions whenever I got stuck. You really helped me a lot throughout the summer and always replied to my queries (even though sometimes they were stupid). I look forward to working with you more in the future.

**Thank you, Werner,** for always reviewing my code, giving me your valuable feedback, and for all your help (which is a lot) that you gave me during my project. I think being a maintainer of FreeType isn't an easy task and you have been doing it for such a long time willingly, I appreciate you for taking out time to work for FreeType and maintaining it.

**Thank you, Behdad,** for initially reviewing my code and giving me your valuable feedback. I was really nervous in the beginning about my code but your [mail](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/freetype-devel/2020-06/msg00106.html) helped me gain confidence in it.

**Thank you, Suzuki, Vincent, David, Timo,** and all the people who gave their valuable feedback and also the people who wrote amazing research papers without whom I wouldn't have been able to finish my project. Thank you all.

That's all,

Anuj
