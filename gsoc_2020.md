# GSoC 2020: Integrating Signed Distance Field Generation in FreeType

Hello All,

My name is Anuj Verma and I am a participant of Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2020 with FreeType. I have been working on a project to integrate the generation of Signed Distance Field (SDF) into the FreeType library. This is the final project of my project as well as my experience with FreeType.

### Project Abstract

Over the summer I have been working on writing renderers for the FreeType library which are capable of generating Signed Distance Fields for two glyph format (i.e. Bitmaps and Outlines). To make this possible I have added a renderer module to the FreeType's amazing modular architecture. The module consist of two renderers, one for each glyph format.
Apart from that I also wrote a small demo program to view the output of the renderers.

### Final Work Product
1. [SDF](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/src/sdf?h=GSoC-2020-anuj) module for FreeType which consist of two seperate renderers:
    - [SDF Renderer](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/src/sdf/ftsdf.c?h=GSoC-2020-anuj) which generate Signed Distance Field for vector fonts. (fonts which contain contours and paths for characters)
    - [BSDF Renderer](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/src/sdf/ftbsdf.c?h=GSoC-2020-anuj) which generate Signed Distance Field for bitmap fonts or for any arbitary bitmap.
2. [FTSDF Demo](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2-demos.git/tree/src/ftsdf.c?h=GSoC-2020-anuj) program to view the output of the renderers.

### Introduction
Signed Distance Field is great when it comes to font rendering in real time graphics applications, they contain enough information to draw high quality fonts without the need of actual vector paths and complex calculations. Moreover due to the nature of distance fields they can be scaled almost upto inifinity and because of that they are great in palces where memory is limited because even a small distance field representation can be scaled up, to generate 4K images.

### Usage
Generating SDF from FreeType is pretty straightforward, the only thing that changes is the render mode. To generate SDF one must use `FT_RENDER_MODE_SDF` and then the output bitmap will contain SDF data instead of alpha values. Some notes:
1. Make sure to checkout the `GSoC-2020-anuj` branch.
```bash
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/freetype/freetype2.git
cd freetype2
git checkout GSoC-2020-anuj
```
2. The build procedure is exactly the same as the official release so refer to the [docs](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/docs?h=GSoC-2020-anuj) for how to build the library.
3. The official [tutorial](https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/tutorial/step1.html) can be used, the only thing that will change is:
```c
error = FT_Render_Glyph( face->glyph, render_mode );
```
In place of `render_mode` use `FT_RENDER_MODE_SDF`
```c
error = FT_Render_Glyph( face->glyph, FT_RENDER_MODE_SDF );
```
4. As of now the only documentation about the output is in the source code itself. The output of any render call in FreeType is a [`FT_BITMAP`](https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-basic_types.html#ft_bitmap). Most of the fields are exactly the same as given in the docs, the few things that are different are stated below:
    - [`pixel_mode`](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/include/freetype/ftimage.h?h=GSoC-2020-anuj#n160): The SDF module outputs 16 bit buffer containing signed distance for each position on the grid.
    - `num_grays` : The output can have as many as 65535 different values.

### Usage [Demo Program]
There is also a demo program which can be used to test the output of the new renderers. The demo program is also integrated with the FreeType2's official demo programs. To build and run the demo simply follow the official [guide](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2-demos.git/tree/README?h=GSoC-2020-anuj). A few notes:
1. Make sure to checkout the `GSoC-2020-anuj` branch.
```bash
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/freetype/freetype2-demos.git
cd freetype2-demos
git checkout GSoC-2020-anuj
```
2. Use the `ftsdf` demo program after the build step.
```bash
./ftsdf <point_size> <font_file>
```
3. After running the program press `?` or `F1` to see various keys which can be used to play around in the program.
